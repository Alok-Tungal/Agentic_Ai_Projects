# 🤖 AI Website Builder  
### 🧩 Prompt-to-Website Generator

**AI Website Builder** is an AI-powered web application that converts **natural language prompts into fully functional frontend websites**.  
Users simply describe the website they want, and the AI instantly generates clean, structured **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, packages everything into a ZIP file, and makes it ready for download.

This project demonstrates **prompt engineering, LLM-controlled code generation, and automated file packaging**, making it highly relevant for modern AI & GenAI roles.

## ✨ What This App Does

📝 User enters a short description of the desired website  
🧠 AI generates complete frontend code:
- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`  
📦 All files are automatically packaged into a ZIP  
⬇️ User downloads the ZIP and runs the website locally  

---

## 🎯 Key Features

⚡ Generate full frontend websites from natural language prompts  
🧱 Clean separation of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**  
🚫 No frameworks or external libraries in generated code  
📦 One-click ZIP file download  
🧼 Simple, clean, beginner-friendly Streamlit UI  
🧠 Strong prompt engineering for structured and predictable AI output

## 🧠 How It Works

1️⃣ User provides a **website description prompt**  
2️⃣ A **strict system prompt** instructs the LLM to return code in a fixed format  
3️⃣ The AI generates:
- HTML content  
- CSS styles  
- JavaScript logic  
4️⃣ The application:
- Extracts code blocks using string parsing  
- Writes files locally (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`)  
- Packages them into a ZIP archive  
5️⃣ ZIP file is provided to the user for instant download
